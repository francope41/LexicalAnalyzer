# Project Phase I: Lexical Analysis
# By Eulises Franco

Project Phase I consists in building a Lexical Analyzer for the "Decaf 22" programming language

In order to run this program go inside workdir directory.
Make sure exec.sh has executable permissions.

If script has executable permissions:
    use command ./exec.sh <file path>   to execute and display on terminal the proper lexical analysis of the input file provided

To add executable permissions in linux use command:
    chmod +x filename

!!!! Important !!!!
Make sure main.py and utils.py are on the same directory outside workdir.
When running the command must be executed inside workdir and main.py and utils.py must be outside of workdir directory.
